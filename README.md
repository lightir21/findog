# FinDog

## An adopting dogs platform by various categories

this project was built as an idea to provide dogs shelter a way to put up dogs to for adoption.
users can browse through the collections of dogs, see their stats and filter by various categories. 
(there is a button to upload a dog just to show the functionality)

it was built with:
* React for the front end side of things in order to organize the code with simple and scalable components.
* Scss in order to style the project with the ease of BEM methodology
* Firebase for the back end side in order to upload dogs with all their stats and picture
